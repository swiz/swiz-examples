			Beans can be added and removed at runtime.
			BeanLoader is not yet implemented in this release but will implement IBeanProvider once it is.
			beanProviders is the default property for Swiz, so you can define them directly inside the Swiz tag.

			Swiz's customProcessors property is where you assign custom metadata processors.

			Definitely check out their source to see how easy they are to implement.
			Swiz uses this exact mechanism to implement its built in metadata tags like Autowire, Mediate and VirtualBean.
